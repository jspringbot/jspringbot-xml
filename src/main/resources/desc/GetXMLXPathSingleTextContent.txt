Returns the XML a single text content given the xpath expression

Example:
| ${description}= | `Get XML XPath Single Text Content` | //catalog/book[1]/description | # This is similar to specifying "//catalog/book/description" as xpathExpression since this will only return a single text content. |

Result:
| ${description} = An in-depth look at creating applications with XML.
